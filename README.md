# File-Upload-Frontend
This plugin allows WordPress users to add an upload form for files on the front-end of their own site and allows for <a href="http://www.library.international">www.library.international</a> to release the content which gets uploaded in the public domain.</p>

Simply install and activate on your WordPress site, and then use the shortcode [file-frontend-upload license=”publicdomain,libraryinternational”] (add other values to the license by separating them with a comma) to add it to the page or post you wish to display it on.

When you add the plugin to your site, any uploads using the plugin will be shared publicly with library.international and licensed to be in the public domain.
