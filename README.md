# File-Upload-Frontend
This plugin allows WordPress users to add an upload form for files on the front-end of their site, and allows for www.library.international to release the content in the public domain.

Simply install and activate on your WordPress site, and then use the shortcode [file-frontend-upload license=”publicdomain,libraryinternational”] (add other values to the license by seperating them with a comma) to add it to the page or post you wish to display it on.

When you add the plugin to your site, any uploads using the plugin will be shared publicly with librry.international and licensed to be in the public domain.
